# ProcessMiningOnFHIR
Enabling Mining of Processes in HL7 FHIR

## Build

The files inside the auditlog-fhir-server are part of the adaptions as well as of the hapi starter project. Thus these Dockerfile/compose are not in use in our project, but are in there for the completness. The build of our docker images is based on the Dockerfile of the root of the repository.
